		Ideas Bank is an experiment in open sourcing the more abstract notion of ideas. I am a strong believer in the open source philosphy of selfless sharing of information, concepts, technology and knowledge amongst peers to move beyond the ability of the initial creator to seek input from others who may be of benefit.
		<br><br>
		I think however this philosophy and culture can be taken further. I believe that if we all, regardless of our education or ability, shared everything amongst eachother the best concepts would be paired with the best minds. If I were to stumble across a great idea, who is to say I was the best person to follow that idea through? How do I know that I would be able to take that idea to it's full potential? If that idea was shared, or made available to all then perhaps the chance of that happening is greater. Often mixing with those who think in an entirely different way can lead to exciting developments, but meeting them in the first place is difficult. By branching out new relationships could be formed with people who would never get the chance to meet. 
		<br><br>
		Of course there are many arguments against this way of thinking, sharing can easily be counteracted by stealing. By openly displaying many new, bright ideas, the service could easily be exploited by those who have not yet found a bright idea but are desparately looking for one. Rather than working with people to develop it, the idea could be taken outright.
		<br><br>
		Ultimately this is an experiment and I am well aware that this fundementally opposes the human condition. We want our creations to benefit ourselves, and sharing ideas for the benefit of the idea itself is a hard thing for us to do. But perhaps just by making tools such as Ideas Bank, it is a step in a positive direction.
