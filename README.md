*Ideas Bank* is a website which aims to provide a platform for anyone and everyone to share _any_ idea they may have with others. I believe strongly in a open-source community and the strengths of sharing information and I believe the sharing of ideas comes into that too. If we were all willing to share our best ideas, the hope is that it would then lead to a world in which we are more willing to take on other peoples ideas and work collaboratively towards a common goal.

If you have any ideas regarding the webiste itself, either post them on the page! or please let me know on here.

The website was my first venture into the realms of PHP and MySQL so I'm sure the code is messy and hard to follow but I will get round to commenting the code and trying my best to tidy it up in good time.

##Tools

If it is of any interest to any one (I know it would be to me), my text editor of choice for building this website was Sublime Text 2. I also instantly fell in love with Live Reload which is a small app which automatically refreshes the web page you are working on in the browser each time you save the file - it makes web development so much easier.

I also locally hosted the website on my Mac using MAMP which worked perfectly. This is a great tutorial explaiong how to set it all up: http://sawmac.com/mamp/virtual/
