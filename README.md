*Ideas Bank* is a website which aims to provide a platform for anyone and everyone to share _any_ idea they may have with others. I believe strongly in a open-source community and the strengths of sharing information and I believe the sharing of ideas comes into that too. If we were all willing to share our best ideas, the hope is that it would then lead to a world in which we are more willing to take on other peoples ideas and work collaboratively towards a common goal.
